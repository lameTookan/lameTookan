- Hi I am Alex!
- Here to document my python journey
- Started learning python seriously May 12th.
- My pfp is of the late great Tulula Bankhead. I do not look like her, I am actually a 25 year old man living in the SF Bay Area!
- email me at lameToucan@gmail.com if you don't have a github account and wanna get in touch!
<!---
lameTookan/lameTookan is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
